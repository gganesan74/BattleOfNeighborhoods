Git repository for Coursera Data Science Capstone project

This repository contains the docs and the code for the Data Science Capstone final project from Coursera. For my project I construct a Culinary Diversity Index to measure the diversity of cuisines in each city. I compare this metric for major cities in North America to find which city offers more diverse cuisines.
